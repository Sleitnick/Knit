For the sake of simplicity, they are all in one script for these examples. Now we have a little MoneyService that can get and give money to a player. However, only the server can use this at the moment. What if we want clients to fetch how much money they have? To do this, we have to create some client-side code to consume our service. We could create a controller, but it's not necessary for this example. First, we need to expose a method to the client. We can do this by writing methods on the service's Client table: -- Money service on the server ... function MoneyService.Client:GetMoney(player) -- We already wrote this method, so we can just call the other one. -- 'self.Server' will reference back to the root MoneyService. return self.Server:GetMoney(player) end ...  We can write client-side code to fetch money from the service: -- Client-side code local Knit = require(game:GetService(&quot;ReplicatedStorage&quot;).Packages.Knit) Knit.Start():catch(warn):await() local MoneyService = Knit.GetService(&quot;MoneyService&quot;) MoneyService:GetMoney():andThen(function(money) print(money) end) -- Don't want to use promises?

The consequence of Knit taking control of the bootstrapping process is that all loaded services end up in a generic table (think of a bucket of assorted items). Due to the dynamic nature of this process, there is no way for Luau's type system to understand the type of a service simply based on the string name (e.g. Knit.GetService(&quot;HelloService&quot;); Luau can't statically understand that this is pointing to a specific service table).

The client will then be able to easily read this property: -- Create the RemoteProperty: PointsService.Client.Points = Knit.CreateProperty(0) function PointsService:AddPoints(player, amount) local points = self:GetPoints(player) points += amount self.PointsPerPlayer[player] = points self.Client.Points:SetFor(player, points) end  On the client, we can now easily read the Points property: -- LocalScript local Knit = require(game:GetService(&quot;ReplicatedStorage&quot;).Packages.Knit) local PointsService = Knit.GetService(&quot;PointsService&quot;) -- The 'Observe' method will fire for the current value and any time the value changes: PointsService.Points:Observe(function(points) print(&quot;Current number of points:&quot;, points) end)  Using Observe is the easiest way to track the value of a RemoteProperty on the client. Remote Property See the RemoteProperty andClientRemotePropertydocumentation for more info on how to use the RemoteProperty and ClientRemoteProperty objects.
