"},{"title":"A Simple Service​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Getting Started","url":"docs/gettingstarted#a-simple-service","content":"A service is simply a structure that serves some specific purpose. For instance, a game might have a MoneyService, which manages in-game currency for players.

For the sake of simplicity, they are all in one script for these examples. Now we have a little MoneyService that can get and give money to a player. However, only the server can use this at the moment. What if we want clients to fetch how much money they have? To do this, we have to create some client-side code to consume our service. We could create a controller, but it's not necessary for this example. First, we need to expose a method to the client. We can do this by writing methods on the service's Client table: -- Money service on the server ... function MoneyService.Client:GetMoney(player) -- We already wrote this method, so we can just call the other one. -- 'self.Server' will reference back to the root MoneyService. return self.Server:GetMoney(player) end ... Copy We can write client-side code to fetch money from the service: -- Client-side code local Knit = require(game:GetService(&quot;ReplicatedStorage&quot;).Packages.Knit) Knit.Start():catch(warn):await() local MoneyService = Knit.GetService(&quot;MoneyService&quot;) MoneyService:GetMoney():andThen(function(money) print(money) end) -- Don't want to use promises?

"},{"title":"Creating Services​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Services","url":"docs/services#creating-services","content":"In its simplest form, a service can be created like so: local PointsService = Knit.CreateService { Name = &quot;PointsService&quot;, Client = {} } return PointsService Copy Client table optional The Client table is optional for the constructor. However, it will be added by Knit if left out. For the sake of code clarity, it is recommended to keep it in the constructor as shown above. No client table forces server-only mode If the Client table is omitted, the service will be interpreted as server-side only. This means that the client will not be able to access this service using Knit.GetService on the client. The Name field is required. This name is how code outside of your service will find it. This name must be unique from all other services. It is best practice to name your variable the same as the service name (e.g. local PointsService matches Name = &quot;PointsService&quot;). The last line (return PointsService) assumes this code is written in a ModuleScript, which is best practice for containing services.

This is part of the Knit lifecycle (read more under execution model). These methods are optional, but very useful for orchestrating communication between other services. When a service is first created, it is not guaranteed that other services are also created and ready to be used. The KnitInit and KnitStart methods come to save the day! After all services are created and the Knit.Start() method is fired, the KnitInit methods of all services will be fired. From the KnitInit method, we can guarantee that all other services have been created. However, we still cannot guarantee that those services are ready to be consumed. Therefore, we can reference them within the Init step, but we should never use them (e.g. use the methods or events attached to those other services). After all KnitInit methods have finished, all KnitStart methods are then fired. At this point, we can guarantee that all KnitInits are done, and thus can freely access other services. In order to maintain this pattern, be sure to set up your service in the Init method (or earlier; just in the ModuleScript itself). By the time KnitStart methods are being fired, your services should be available for use.

We have created a memory leak! When we add points for a player, we add the player to the table. What happens when the player leaves? Nothing! And that's a problem. That player's data is forever held onto within that PointsPerPlayer table. To fix this, we need to clear out that data when the player leaves. We can use the KnitInit method to hook up to the Players.PlayerRemoving event and remove the data: function PointsService:KnitInit() game:GetService(&quot;Players&quot;).PlayerRemoving:Connect(function(player) -- Clear out the data for the player when the player leaves: self.PointsPerPlayer[player] = nil end) end Copy While memory management is not unique to Knit, it is still an important aspect to consider when making your game.

This is where we are going to use that Client table defined at the beginning. "},{"title":"Methods​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Services","url":"docs/services#methods","content":"Let's say that we want to create a method that lets players fetch how many points they have, and when their points change. First, let's make a method to fetch points: function PointsService.Client:GetPoints(player) -- We can just call our other method from here: return self.Server:GetPoints(player) end Copy This creates a client-exposed method called GetPoints. Within it, we reach back to our top-level service using self.Server and then invoke our other GetPoints method that we wrote before. In this example, we've basically just created a proxy for another method; however, this will not always be the case. There will be many times where a client method will exist alone without an equivalent server-side-only method. Under the hood, Knit will create a RemoteFunction and bind this method to it. On the client, we could then invoke the service as such: -- From a LocalScript local Knit = require(game:GetService(&quot;ReplicatedStorage&quot;).Packages.Knit) local PointsService = Knit.GetService(&quot;PointsService&quot;) PointsService:GetPoints():andThen(function(points) print(&quot;Points for myself:&quot;, points) end) Copy "},{"title":"Signals (Server-to-Client)​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Services","url":"docs/services#signals-server-to-client","content":"We should also create a signal that we can fire events for the clients when their points change.

Under the hood, Knit is using the Comm module, which is creating a RemoteEvent object linked to this event. This is a two-way signal (like a transceiver), so we can both send and receive data on both the server and the client. We can then modify our AddPoints method again to fire this signal too: function PointsService:AddPoints(player, amount) local points = self:GetPoints(player) points += amount self.PointsPerPlayer[player] = points if amount ~= 0 then self.PointsChanged:Fire(player, points) -- Fire the client signal: self.Client.PointsChanged:Fire(player, points) end end Copy And from the client, we can listen for an event on the signal: -- From a LocalScript local Knit = require(game:GetService(&quot;ReplicatedStorage&quot;).Packages.Knit) local PointsService = Knit.GetService(&quot;PointsService&quot;) PointsService.PointsChanged:Connect(function(points) print(&quot;Points for myself now:&quot;, points) end) Copy "},{"title":"Signals (Client-to-Server)​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Services","url":"docs/services#signals-client-to-server","content":"Signal events can also be fired from the client.

We will create another client-exposed signal called GiveMePoints which will randomly give the player points. Again, this is nonsense in the context of an actual game, but useful for example. Let's create the signal on the PointsService: local PointsService = Knit.CreateService { Name = &quot;PointsService&quot;, Client = { PointsChanged = Knit.CreateSignal(), GiveMePoints = Knit.CreateSignal(), -- Create the new signal }, } Copy Now, let's listen for the client to fire this signal.
